# Agentic-Ciriculum

This repository is a curated, hands-on journey from beginner-level fundamentals to advanced agentic AI systemsâ€”built entirely from scratch. Whether you're just starting out or already have experience, these projects are designed to be modular, understandable, and progressively challenging. Each project includes well-documented code, learning objectives, and explanations that make it easy to follow, remix, or expand. Ideal for self-learners, educators, and developers who want to deepen their understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and intelligent agents through practical, ground-up implementations.
